# Visual_Auditory_Confidence_Computations

Code related to the following project: "Modality Independent or Modality Specific? Common Computations Underlie Confidence Judgements in Visual and Auditory Decisions"

## Project Details 
We investigated the computational processes that underlie confidence judgements and the extent to which these computations are the same for perceptual decisions in the visual and auditory modalities. Participants completed two versions of a categorisation task with visual or auditory stimuli and made confidence judgements about their category decisions. We evaluated several classes of models of confidence: 1) unscaled evidence strength models, 2) scaled evidence strength models, and 3) Bayesian models.
