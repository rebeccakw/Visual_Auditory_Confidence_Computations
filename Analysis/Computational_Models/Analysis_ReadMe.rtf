This folder contains code for the computational models. The folder/set-up is different for the different means and different SDs task because the different means code was written earlier in the project (there is less redundancy in the code for the different SDs models). For the different means models, each model (and the code to run the model, simulate data and sample parameters) is contained in its own folder. For the different SDs models, the code is split by model classes (with the exception of the Bayesian model with orientation dependent noise and the Bayesian model with decision noise) and all models are run using \'91run_models.R\'92 . Please contact rebecca.west1@uq.net.au, if you have any questions. }
