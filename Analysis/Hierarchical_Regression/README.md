# Analysis - Regression Models 

This folder contains two files. These files run hierarchical regression models to predict category (logistic) and confidence (linear) responses from stimulus features. 

'Evidence for category 2' is calculated in category_regression_models.R and 'category diagnosticity' is calculated in the confidence_regression_models.R. See paper for more details.
